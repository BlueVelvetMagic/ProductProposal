FlexPLan (Name in Progressed)

Project Pitch:
Getting into working out can be overwhelming. What exercises should you do? For how long? Do you even have time to do it? FlexPlan will be your personal AI fitness coach. It helps build a completely customized workout plan around your body, schedule and goals and then adapts it in real-time as your life changes. All for the sake of smart, adaptive fitness.

Project Description:
This app will utilize AI to help the user achieve fitness goals, giving them not only a scheduled layout of what days they should be working out, but also the exercises, sets and rep count, and the time frame in which they should be doing said activities. The app will use user information such as height, weight, schedule availability, and goals to give the user a fully fleshed-out layout/plan to complete their fitness goal(s). The AI will continuously make adjustments based on new user feedback such as the difficulty of the plan so far, changes in availability, overall progress, or a change in goals.
